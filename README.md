What Is It?
-----------

This project will provide tools for bird song motif discovery and analysis to the Jarvis Lab at Duke University

Erich Jarvis Lab - Neurobiology of Vocal Communication
Website: http://jarvislab.net/


Current State
-------------

The software is in the initial stages of development.

I have selected a GUI framework for the project - it will use PyQt4, until further notice.
I have designed the first GUI using Qt Designer.

Short-Term Goals
----------------

- Test using the empty Widget in main.ui for a matplotlib Figure
- Implement programmatic control of graph using zoom buttons and scroll bars
- Implement open file button to read audio files
